ABOUT
------------------------------------
You're a cube who runs.

This is a super simple game I made using the Unity game framework
to learn the framework and play around with the physics engine.
After making this game, I can confidently say I still have no
idea how Unity works.


HOW TO PLAY
------------------------------------
WASD to move. Be gentle.
p.s. There's only one level.
